Autonomous-Driving-Detection-Model
This project demonstrates an autonomous driving perception system that uses machine learning models for object detection and lane detection. The system is designed to process images and videos from a self-driving car's camera feed and detect various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and lane markings.

The major tasks are, 
1. Object Detection: Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect and classify objects in images and videos, such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, etc.
2. Lane Detection: Using OpenCV and deep learning techniques to detect lane markings and help self-driving systems navigate safely on roads.

The tech and python libraries used in this project are Python, YOLO Object Detection library, OpenCV for lane detection, Matplotlib to visualize results and Ultralytics YOLOv8 library for object detction.
